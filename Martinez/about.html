	   	<p>ALL CITY Foundation is a community-based arts and health collaborative co-directed by community leaders and long time associates Hugo Martinez and Juan Tapia, MD. Martinez is a gallery owner and expert on urban art; Tapia is a prominent New York City pediatrician. Together, they have assembled a network of artists, designers and medical practitioners to create and runcoordinated arts and health programs in New York City.</p>

		<p>The ALL CITY Foundation is designing and implementing an art-based model of community medicine. The ALL CITY Foundation Healing Communities through Art and Medicine initiative will fully integrate art into pediatric practice as a means to more effectively communicate health literacy and encourage healthy living. Beginning in traditionally underserved Manhattan ethnic and immigrant communities, ALL CITY Health clinics will provide coordinated arts and medical services. The ALL CITY Foundation will develop programs and materials targeted at the real-life challenges confronting at-risk urban youth and families, with a particular focus on adolescent health and social concerns.</p>

		<p>Tackling established concerns in pediatric care, ALL CITY will combat fundamental health threats with methods beyond the proscriptions of established medical procedures. It is widely acknowledged that today’s “millennial morbidities” – infant mortality; childhood obesity; academic failure; domestic violence; intentional injuries; high rates of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections – are best addressed through long-term healing and educational efforts. ALL CITY Health will draw on art and art processes to acknowledge varieties of individual learning styles while also building upon the shared context of community culture. Key to this effort will be a continuing dialogue to maintain, refine and deploy adaptive strategies. Medical staff, artists, graphic designers, architects, museum educators and others will collaborate in the development of interior spaces, exhibitions, programs and publications that enhance and imprint the “teachable moments” that may occur before, during and after clinic visits. This interactive environment will reiterate and support messages conveyed in the interpersonal interactions of medical staff and patients, allowing more holistic opportunities for cognition and understanding. By acknowledging that good health practices are learned only when fully comprehended, ALL CITY Health will develop as a national prototype for urban pediatric and family medical practices.</p>

		<p>ALL CITY Foundation Executive Co-Directors Hugo Martinez and Juan Tapia, MD met in the fall of 1972: Martinez was a student at City College with an interest in working with street gangs, and Tapia was a teenage graffiti Master in Washington Heights known as C.A.T. 87, as well as a Warlord for the neighborhood division of the Young Savage Nomads gang. The two men have collaborated on many community-based arts and health projects; the ALL CITY Foundation is the most recent development in their near 40-year partnership.</p>

		<p>In 1972, Martinez sought to collaborate with young working class Puerto Ricans to explore constructive possibilities for rechanneling their energies and interests. Martinez approached the Young Galaxies, a local gang in Washington Heights, who directed him to Writers’ Corner 188, a graffiti writing meeting place at 188th Street and Audubon Avenue. At Writers’ Corner Martinez met C.A.T. 87 (Juan Tapia).</p>
